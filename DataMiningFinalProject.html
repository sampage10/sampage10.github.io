            <h2>Intro to Problem</h2>
            <p>Predicting Spotify Top Hits: A Machine Learning Approach to Song Popularity</p>
            <h2>Intro to Data</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paradisejoy/top-hits-spotify-from-20002019/data">Data Set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paradisejoy/top-hits-spotify-from-20002019/data</a></p>
            <p>Our data comes from the “Top Hits Spotify from 2000-2019” dataset on Kaggle, collected by Mark Koverha. The data consists of roughly 1,900 entries across 18 features and is 254.99 kB in size. The first two columns identify variables, giving the artist’s name and song name. There are several variables that people can immediately identify, such as release year or genre, but 11 of the variables give numerical values to elements of the song, such as “acousticness” or “liveness,” which are much harder to quantify.</p>
            <h2>Pre-processing</h2>
            <p>My data was very complete and accurate so it didn't need much preprocessing. There were no nulls and we removed 59 duplicates. We also dropped 3 irrelevant columns.</p>
            <h2>Data Visualization</h2>
            <p>The best visualizations for this data set were a genre distribution chart and correlation map</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Going back to the introduction, these were the three questions we were looking to answer:</p>

            <p>What elements have the strongest impact in propelling songs to the top of the charts?</p>
            
            <p>What types of models best fit with our dataset and what metrics will be used to gain the most insight into our models?</p>
            
            <p>How do different feature selection methods impact model performance? What are the optimal features to place in our model?</p>
            
            <p>So, was the data above able to answer these questions?</p>
            
            <p>Question 1</p>
            
            <p>The best way to answer the first question would be to find the correlation between popularity and other elements in the heatmap shown above. These elements seem to have the highest correlation to popularity:</p>
            
            <p>Two genres had the highest scores, Pop and Dance/Electronic Instrumentalness, Danceability, and Energy seem to have the top correlation scores.</p>
            
            <p>As mentioned briefly in the introduction, it's difficult to use arbitrary elements, such as loudness or danceability, to quantify what makes a song popular. Each person hears music differently, and something that one person likes may be hated by another. However, using the methods above, the dataset showed these elements contribute the most to popularity. Surface level features like a familiar artist or popular genre may help the song get recognized, but these elements do not grant music its staying power months or even years down the road.</p>
            
            <p>One additional note I wanted to point out was the amount of correlation between genres. Whenever any genre is either mixed or classified as multiple genres, the correlation between those increases. Something to keep in mind.</p>
            
            <p>Question 2</p>
            
            <p>Of the created models, the Random Forest Regression model easily performed the best, able to predict within 14 points on average. Of the metrics used for analysis, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) shows the clearest evidence that this model accurately predicts. Of the three models, the linear regression proved the least useful.</p>
            
            <p>Question 3</p>
            
            <p>While models were trained with various selections of features, we found that more data was always better when training our models. Even if the model did not favor the feature as a strong predictor, each variable had some weight with which it could impact the outcomes.</p>
            
            <p>Were this research to be pursued further, we would've liked to gain a more robust dataset, focusing on negatively reviewed music, instead of just the popular items. This may be able to give us even further insight into not only what elements to promote, but what elements could be deemed a waste of time.</p>
            
            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>
                An impact of this project could be a shift in how users of Spotify view genres of music. Some may see the overlap in correlation between genres and think that maybe not all songs advertised as a single genre are the same, and broaden their horizons regarding their listening. Others, may see the overlap and assume that everything is the same, and not listen to any other genre than pop. The beauty of music is in the variety, and the fact that there's so many options to choose from allows people to find something they really like, and only listen to that.
                <br>
                In theory, there could be no correlation between elements of songs, and how things are determined popular. It could just be how good someone is at creating music, making something catchy, and getting noticed at the right place at the right time. The impact of this could be null and void due to that, because modeling and machine learning sometimes isn't able to keep up with the randomness of humanity.
                <br>
                This could also go the other direction with the last point, and cause artists to only focus on the things that make their songs the most popular. If a song doesn't correlate to these arbitrary values, it will never be popular, and thus, never be made. That would be catastrophic for a creative industry, and could lead to a trend that kills all creativity at some point. The likelyhood of this happening is near-zero, but still possible.
